# Isograms

## 1. part

- The code is able to check the empty string.

## 2. part

- The original RegEx caused a warning so it was changed from "\d" to "r'[0-9]'".
- I created a function what can identify the isogram strings.

## 3. part

- I had to numbering the test cases because I got an wierd error.
- The RegEx was modified again becase we got some failed test results.
- The main function was created.
- I have to add str = str.casefold() to UnigueChars function because of the lower and upper case problem.
